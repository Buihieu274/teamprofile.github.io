<pre >                I would like to name my group as passionate people. The reason why I want to take this name 
                because I do not want to have a name following a hobby or an idol of someone in my group but 
                it has to bring the motivation and purpose that everyone will aim for. 
             
                According to the result of learning style test, I am an auditory learner. It means I want to do 
                something to the fullest extent possible and will listen to people from many different sides. 
                Therefore, I want to associate with people who are able to express opinions well. From there, my 
                team can discuss with each other for the best. 

                According to the result of Myers-Briggs test, my personality type is defender. As I wrote 
                above, I prefer to listen rather than read, so I have the ability to justify what people say quickly, 
                helping the team to come up with different solutions and backup solutions.

                According to the result of creativity test, my score is only 46.03. Therefore, I am a safe person 
                with my choices but my paradox score is also high. If it is possible, I want to work with more 
                creative people, not only to learn from each other but also to give more ideas at work.

                To sum up, I would like work in a team that is creative, listening and able to communicate and 
                express ideas well.
